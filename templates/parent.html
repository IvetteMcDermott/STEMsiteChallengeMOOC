      <h4> Some about STEM </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">
        STEM Education is a popular and rising concept of the time in the educational sphere. However, the true meaning of STEM Education is still lost on people, especially parents. STEM is an acronym for studies in the fields of Science, Technological, Engineering, and Mathematics.

        Difference between Traditional and STEM Education
With the development of this modern and revolutionary education method, there can now be contrasts drawn between the traditional method of education and STEM education. The very first difference lies in the fact that the STEM educational approach offers hands-on knowledge and experience in contrast to learning through repetition in the traditional approach. The second and more important factor that contrasts the two is the future potential of the sectors. Traditional education holds no value in interviews for job opportunities nowadays. On the other hand, STEM education is the mix of the most valuable skills a child should have for the practical world. Therefore, a plethora of job opportunities and prospects are open for students engaged in any field of STEM education.
