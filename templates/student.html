      <p class="text"> <strong>Hey there, curious minds!</strong>Have you ever wondered how things work? STEM is like a magical doorway to understanding the world around us. Science lets us explore everything from tiny bugs to gigantic planets. We can ask questions like, 'Why is the sky blue?' and then figure out the answers through cool experiments. Technology is like playing with super smart toys. It helps us create amazing apps, games, and even robots! Ever seen a robot dance? It's all thanks to technology. Engineering is like being a super inventor. Remember building a fort with your building blocks? Engineers design and build things like bridges and spaceships. You could be a builder of the future! Mathematics is like a secret code that helps us solve puzzles. From counting candies to exploring outer space, math is the key. It's like your brain's superpower! So, if you love exploring, inventing, and solving mysteries, STEM is your playground. Who knows, you might be the one to invent flying cars or explore new planets! The fun is just beginning on this awesome adventure called STEM." </p>

              </summary> Have you ever wanted to send your friend a secret message that no-one else can read? Then you might know of invisible ink‚Äîa special type of ink that you can use for writing and that does not show up on paper. Only after a special treatment will it appear again magically, and the message can be read. How does this work? Find out in this activity and write your own secret messages! Click in the image...

              </summary> Have you ever heard that plastic can be made out of milk? If this sounds like something made-up to you, you may be surprised to learn that from the early 1900s until about 1945, milk was commonly used to make many different plastic ornaments, including buttons, decorative buckles, beads and other jewelry, fountain pens, the backings for hand-held mirrors, and fancy comb and brush sets. Milk plastic (usually called casein plastic) was even used to make jewelry for Queen Mary of England! In this activity you will make your own casein plastic out of hot milk and vinegar.

                <h5>Lemon Volcano...</h5>
              </summary> Make a colorful erupting volcano in your kitchen with lemons and baking soda! When you added the baking soda, it started to fizzle and foam a little bit. When you mixed the baking soda into the lemon with a knife, it should have started foaming a lot more, bubbling up and over the sides of the lemon. Eventually the reaction slowed down and stopped. See the Digging Deeper section to learn about the chemical reaction that creates the foam! Click in the image...
